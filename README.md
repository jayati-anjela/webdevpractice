# WEBDEV PRACTICE

A repo where I work on everything my Udemy course teaches (The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp). This repo might include resources/projects/codes included in the course but I do not intend to reshare it as my own work/resource. (Unless of course I code along with the projects and/or make some web app of my own).
